And you forget that you would be horrified if something like this was going to happen to your family. \n\nA lot of people stop at this step. They might not actively participate but would accept that this is just.\n\n4/ The atrocity happens, perpetuated by people who are so strong in their beliefs and labelling that they can wipe away the simple fact that all people are human beings. It's funny, kind of, that if the 'outsider' did this atrocity to you and your family then justice would be on your side to stop them from doing it again.\n\n\nHow do you stop this? It's very easy and very hard. You have to remove the labels from yourself. That's very difficult...",1),

Thus people who read that expression of Reality called the Scriptures become stupid and cruel for they follow, not their common sense, but what they think their Scriptures say.' \n\nHe had the perfect parable to show this: \n\nA village blacksmith found an apprentice willing to work hard at low pay. The smith immediately began his instructions to the lad: 'When I take the metal out of the fire, I'll lay it on the anvil; and when I nod my head you hit it with the hammer.' The apprentice did precisely what he thought he was told. Next day he was the village blacksmith\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Nonsense",1),

The aim of spirituality, he claimed, is to make all life play.\n\nThis seemed too frivolous for a puritanical visitor. 'Is their no room then for work?'\n\n'Of course there is. But work becomes spiritual only when it is transformed into play.'\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Nonsense",1),

If we truly enjoyed things, he claimed, we would be spontaneously moderate.\n\nAsked why he was so opposed to ascetical practices, he replied, 'Because they produce pleasure-haters who always become people-haters — rigid and cruel.'\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Nonsense",1),

In short, a religious belief is only a finger pointing to the moon. \n\nSome religious people never get beyond the study of the finger. \n\nOthers are engaged in sucking it. \n\nOthers yet use the finger to gouge their eyes out. These are the bigots whom religion has made blind. \n\nRare indeed is the religionist who is sufficiently detached from the finger to see what it is indicating — these are those who, having gone beyond belief, are taken for blasphemers.\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Nonsense",1),

Happiness is the natural state of little children, to whom the kingdom belongs until they have been polluted and contaminated by the stupidity of society and culture. \n\nTo acquire happiness you don't have to do anything, because happiness cannot be acquired. Does anybody know why? Because we have it already. \n\nHow can you acquire what you already have? Then why don't you experience it? Because you've got to drop something. You've got to drop illusions. You don't have to add anything in order to be happy; you've got to drop something. \n\nLife is easy, life is delightful. It's only hard on your illusions, your ambitions, your greed, your cravings. Do you know where these things come from? From having identified with all kinds of labels!\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, Awareness : The Perils and Oppurtunities of Reality",1),

Suffering occurs when you clash with reality. \n\nWhen your illusions clash with reality when your falsehoods clash with the truth, then you have suffering. \n\nOtherwise there is no suffering.\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, Awareness : The Perils and Oppurtunities of Reality",1),

    			new Quote("As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you are finished. No reality fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. \n\nThat is why people are always searching for a meaning to life. But life has no meaning; it cannot have meaning because meaning is a formula; meaning is something that makes sense to the mind. \n\nEvery time you make sense out of reality, you bump into something that destroys the sense you made. \n\nMeaning is only found when you go beyond meaning. \n\nLife only makes sense when you perceive it as mystery and it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, Awareness : The Perils and Oppurtunities of Reality",1),
    			new Quote("This is what Wisdom means: To be changed without the slightest effort on your part, to be transformed, believe it or not, merely by waking to the reality that is not words, that lies beyond the reach of words. \n\nIf you are fortunate enough to be Awakened thus, you will know why the finest language is the one that is not spoken, the finest action is the one that is not done and the finest change is the one that is not willed.\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Nonsense",1),
    			new Quote("To a disciple who was forever complaining about others the Master said, 'If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.'\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Wisdom",1),
    			new Quote("To a visitor who asked to become his disciple the Master said, 'You may live with me, but don't become my follower.'\n\n'Whom, then, shall I follow?' \n\n'No one. The day you follow someone you cease to follow Truth.'\n\n -- Anthony De Mello, One Minute Wisdom",1),

    			new Quote("Be careful if you are a rescuer as you can end up treating the other person as a victim. Also, by trying to help to gain a reward of thanks you are increasing your chances of being bitter if no thanks arrives. Sometimes this can even turn you into a persecuter.  \n\nInstead, only help if you recognise that each person has the ability to fix their own problems and you don't expect to be thanked but still want to help.",1),
    			new Quote("Make a decision when you are calm, composed and know what your long term goals are. It may not always be the right decision but it will be the best you can do at the time. \n\nRemember to review your decisions regularly too. A former bad decision can be made worse if it's not recognised and changed.",1),
